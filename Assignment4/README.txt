The included Makefile should build all sources on Linux/UNIX. There are targets
for `given`, `mine`, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, `v4`, and `report`. The report is done in
LaTeX and the Makefile target (`report`) will output a pdf file (provided that
pdflatex is installed, if not a pdf has been included in the submitted archive).

The `mine` target will produce all version that the assignment required that I
implement, the targets `v1`, `v2`, `v3` and `v4` will respectively produce the
first, second and third versions that the assignment required I implement, while
the `given` target will produce the version that was given with the assignment.
